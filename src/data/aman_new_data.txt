Future Goals
I am focused on expanding my skills beyond frontend development and transitioning into a Full Stack Developer role. I am currently honing my backend expertise in Node.js, ExpressJS, and databases to build end-to-end web applications that deliver seamless user experiences.


As I continue to refine my frontend expertise, my current focus is on mastering backend development. I aim to become a Full Stack Developer by gaining proficiency in Node.js, ExpressJS, and cloud technologies. This will enable me to deliver comprehensive solutions that cover both user experience and server-side logic.
